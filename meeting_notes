Limitations:
Single container per Node.
GPU
Minor Security
Continues Spot node after evacuation
#Not mandatory to make it work
Might not work with deployments
Restore might work and may not
Nice To Have - use it only for pods that are running on spot worker nodes.
Deployment/Stateful sets might be in risk for working.


To Check:
what happens in k8s when aws spot instance wants to close the node

Architecture change

Technical questions:

Set up kind + mutating admission controller
How to label the pods that we are running, how do we know if a pod is down and goes up, how should we know it should be restored
Cleanup for previous image
Checkpoint every X
Mice to have - multiple checkpoints time , default will be 5 minutes for all pods
If time is not enough to upload images, skip next image.
image repo - local? docker hub of k8s.
Status update using through CRD - how many pods are we looking into, how many currently checkpointed, how many was restored
Base64 encryption
quey increption

Operator SDK - create empty operator
